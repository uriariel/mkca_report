Thus far, key commitment has not been considered an essential security goal for most cryptographic applications.
This is perhaps because attacks exploiting key collision have arisen in relatively niche applications like
message franking for encrypted messages.

\cite{grubs} introduces partitioning oracle attacks, a new type of CCA in password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE).
A partitioning oracle arises when an attacker can:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item efficiently prepare ciphertexts that will decrypt under a large number of keys
    \item submit those ciphertexts to an oracle that tells whether decryption succeeds or fails.
\end{enumerate}

This enables gaining information about the password.
