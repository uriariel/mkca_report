Multi Key Collision Attacks is an attack where we find a ciphertext - C that decrypts under k different keys $K_{1},\ldots,K_{k}$ to
$k$ different valid plaintexts $P_{1},\ldots,P_{k}$.

In practice, to perform a multi key collision attack against AES-GCM
we need to solve a system of linear equations.
This is possible because of the algebraic properties of the universal hashing in AES-GCM.
The number of required correctly decrypting keys - k will affect the size of the ciphertext C.
