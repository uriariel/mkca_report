Multi Key Collision Attacks is an attack where we find a ciphertext - C that decrypts under k different keys $K_{1},\ldots,K_{k}$ to
$k$ different valid plaintexts $P_{1},\ldots,P_{k}$.

In practice, to perform a multi key collision attack against AES-GCM
we need to solve a system of linear equations.
This is possible because of the algebraic properties of the universal hashing in AES-GCM.
To successfully mount such an attack we will need an oracle that will be telling us whether decryption fails or succeeds.

We formalize our cryptanalytic goal as follows:

Let $AEAD = ({AuthEnc},{AuthDec})$ be an AEAD scheme, and let its key space be the set K.
We write encryption ${AuthEncK}(N,{AD},M)$ to denote running the encryption algorithm with secret key $K \in K$,
nonce N (a bit string), associated data ${AD}$ (a bit string), and message M (a bit string).
Decryption is written analogously, as ${AuthDecK}(N,{AD},C)$ where C is a ciphertext.
Our attacks will require that decryption fails for $K \notin K$.
We require of our AEAD scheme that ${AuthDecK}(N,{AD},{AuthEncK}(N,{AD},M)) = M$ for all
$N,{AD},M$ not exceeding the schemeâ€™s length restrictions.


At a high level, our multi-collision attack against AES-GCM reduces the task of finding key multi-collisions to solving
a system of linear equations.
This is possible because of the algebraic properties of the universal hashing underlying
integrity protection in AES-GCM\cite{mg04}.

For a set $K = {K_1,\dots,K_k}$ and nonce N, one can compute a single ciphertext $(C_1,\dots,C_{k-1},T)$
that decrypts correctly under every key in K.
For each $K_i$, derive the associated GHASH key $H_i = E_{K_i}(0^n)$ and then construct the linear equation.

which one arrives at by assigning $H_i$ to H and then substituting the result into the equation
$T = h \oplus E_{K_i}(N || 0^{31}1)$.
Note that we have fixed the number of the
ciphertext blocks to be k-1.
The resulting system of k equations in k unknowns will be:

where $B_i = (L \cdot H_i) \oplus E_{K_i}(N || 0^{31}1)$.
We can optimize this system of equations and transform it to a system which can be solved in time $O(k^2)$ and space $O(k)$.

For such a system to be solvable, there have to be rows that are linear combinations of other rows.
Since each row is increasing powers of a random field element (i.e., the hash key) this
dependence between rows should be rare as long as the
block cipher acts like an ideal cipher.
