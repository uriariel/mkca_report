Multi Key Collision Attacks is an attack where we find a ciphertext - C that decrypts under k different keys.

In practice, to perform a multi key collision attack against AES-GCM
we need to solve a system of linear equations.
This is possible because of the algebraic properties of the universal hashing in AES-GCM.
