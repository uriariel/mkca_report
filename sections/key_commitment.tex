Key commitment guarantees that a ciphertext can only be
decrypted under the same key it was encrypted with.
If we are to find a ciphertext that decrypts into two valid plaintexts under two different keys do not commit with respect to the key.

Key commitment was initially studied by\cite{for17} and while it might seem like an academic pursuit, \cite{dgrw18} and \cite{glr17} show how to exploit AEADs that do not commit to their key.
Nevertheless, AEAD key commitment has not received the required attention and can be overlooked in deployment.

A committing encryption scheme is a scheme for which it is computationally unfeasible to find two keys and a ciphertext that decrypts under both.
Security standards for committing AEADs were first formalized by\cite{for17}.
