    In this report we examine key commitment in Authenticated encryption and vulnerabilities that
    arise when it is not used exactly as designed.
    Recent research shows new class of attacks such as partitioning oracles which arise when AE
    schemes are not committing with respect to their keys.
    As key commitment is not part of AEâ€™s design goal, AE schemes in general do not satisfy
    it.
    \\
    We show an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack that utilizes
    key multi-collision against widely used AEAD schemes, including
    AES-GCM, XSalsa20/Poly1305, and ChaCha20/Poly1305, to build a partitioning oracle.
    \\
    We also discuss an early implementation of the OPAQUE protocol (a protocol for password-based key exchange) that is vulnerable to partitioning oracle.
