In the future we plan to build a partitioning oracle on one the rust implementation of OPAQUE\cite{opaque} using the
described multi key collision attack on AES-GCM\@.

Another interesting question that raises is to whether quantum computing will allow efficiently solving very large
systems of equations thus maybe extending this attack to large key spaces, and rendering AEADs fully
vulnerable to partitioning oracles.
